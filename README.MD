# Unipkg

Package Manager Portability for Linux

## What is Unipkg?

Ever migrated from Ubuntu to Arch, and found yourself looking for those pesky library packages such as `libjson-c-dev`?
Unipkg aims to solve this exact problem and many more by providing a universal package database.

Unipkg is not a package manager but instead is a database in which you can query package names with a predictable format.

## Goals

Unipkg has the goal to unify all package managers together, through providing a wrapper script which can download and install packages in a distro-specific way.
